# 2024_wombat_seasonal_microbiome
Repository containing code for reproducing the analyses and figures for: "Individual variation and seasonal shifts in the gut microbiome of a large burrowing herbivore (Lasiorhinus latifrons) across the rainfall range of its distribution"

Raw sequencing reads are available at [Bioproject: PRJNA1110067](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA1110067)

### Note
I'm in the process of refactoring the code for readability (into a .qmd file), but everything should be in the `code/` folder.
